# AUTOHUB by IUT CARBON   

This is an academic project which is done by some students of IUT CSE-19.

### About this project

Autohub is an e-commerce platform that connects autoists and workshops. The number
of automobiles in our country is increasing but when it comes to car repair the process is
very out-of-date. For this, the current services are time consuming and tedious.There is
difficulty to find appropriate parts and because of miscommunication there is a possibility
of vehicle damage due to wrong services.A centralized car service system can solve these
types of problems.The platform will be on an website where an integrated system would
connect all the car owners and the registered service providers throughout the country.
The website will have the details of the available workshop services and users can claim
these services according to their needs.The system will provide suggestions based on the
location and needs.General features are: make appointments,search based on service/parts
needed,home delivery service,previous appointment history, emergency service,review
and rating. Our system will provide these services and take a commission.
